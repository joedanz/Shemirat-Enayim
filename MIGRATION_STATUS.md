## Risks & Mitigation

### High-Risk Items
⚠️ **Scope Creep**: May take longer than 21 days
   → Mitigation: Strict prioritization, cut non-essentials

⚠️ **Component Complexity**: Custom components may be hard to replicate
   → Mitigation: Use AstroWind's components where possible

⚠️ **Content Migration Errors**: 57 pages is a lot to convert
   → Mitigation: Automated scripts, careful testing

### Recovery Plan
If migration fails:
1. Checkout backup branch: `git checkout backup-before-astrowind-migration`
2. Or restore from archive: `tar -xzf shemiratenayim-backup-20251002.tar.gz`
3. Original site is 100% intact and functional

---

## Key Decisions

### ✅ Decided
1. Use MDX for guide pages (easier to maintain)
2. Tailwind CSS for all styling (replace CSS variables)
3. Keep same URL structure (SEO preservation)
4. AstroWind's dark mode system (better than custom)

### ❓ To Decide
1. Keep or replace search implementation?
2. Use AstroWind's analytics or custom Plausible?
3. Blog functionality - completely disable or keep for future?
4. Custom infographics - rebuild as components or static SVG?

## Notes
- Original project: 91% complete, production-ready
- This migration essentially restarts from 0%
- Timeline is aggressive but achievable with full-time focus
- Backup safety nets are in place
- Consider hybrid approach if timeline becomes unrealistic

## Alternative Approach
If full migration proves too time-consuming:
- Keep current codebase
- Add Tailwind alongside CSS variables
- Cherry-pick AstroWind components
- Gradual adoption vs. complete rewrite
- **Estimated time savings**: 80% (4 days vs 21 days)
