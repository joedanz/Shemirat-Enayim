		<h2>Why Social Media Requires Special Attention</h2>
		<p>
			Social media is fundamentally different from other internet activities. It's designed to be addictive, leverages peer pressure, creates permanent digital footprints, and opens direct communication channels with potentially millions of strangers. Unlike passive content consumption, social media involves identity formation, social interaction, and public performance during the vulnerable teenage years.
		</p>

		<div class="alert alert-warning">
			<strong>Key Statistic:</strong> Studies show teens spend an average of 4.8 hours per day on social media, and 35% of teens say they use at least one social media platform "almost constantly." This affects sleep, mental health, academic performance, and real-world relationships.
		</div>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>🚦 Readiness Checklist</h2>
		<p>Before allowing your teen to create their first social media account, they should be able to:</p>

		<div class="checklist">
			<ul>
				<li>Explain what information should never be shared publicly (full name, address, school name, phone number, location)</li>
				<li>Understand that posts are permanent even if deleted</li>
				<li>Recognize warning signs of predatory behavior</li>
				<li>Agree to keep their account private and only accept known friends/followers</li>
				<li>Commit to letting parents follow/friend them and review their account</li>
				<li>Understand consequences of inappropriate content or cyberbullying</li>
				<li>Know how to block, report, and come to you with problems</li>
				<li>Demonstrate emotional maturity to handle peer pressure and comparison</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<strong>Recommendation:</strong> Start with one platform (Instagram or YouTube) before allowing multiple accounts. Master safety on one before expanding.

		<div class="bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800 border-2 border-blue-200 dark:border-blue-700 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
			<h3>Instagram (Meta)</h3>
			<p><strong>Minimum Age:</strong> 13+ | <strong>Primary Risk:</strong> Comparison culture, mental health impacts, direct messaging</p>

			<h4>How Instagram Works</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Photo and video sharing platform</li>
				<li>Algorithmic feed shows content based on engagement</li>
				<li>Direct messaging (DMs) with followers or anyone</li>
				<li>Stories disappear after 24 hours (but can be screenshot)</li>
				<li>Reels compete with TikTok for attention</li>
				<li>Heavy use of filters and edited content</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Key Dangers</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Mental health:</strong> Comparison culture, anxiety, depression linked to heavy use</li>
				<li><strong>Predators:</strong> Adults creating fake accounts to contact teens</li>
				<li><strong>Inappropriate content:</strong> Algorithms can push concerning content</li>
				<li><strong>Cyberbullying:</strong> Comments, DMs, exclusion</li>
				<li><strong>Sextortion:</strong> Strangers requesting/demanding inappropriate photos</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Essential Privacy Settings</h4>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Switch to Private Account:</strong> Settings → Privacy → Private Account (ON)</li>
				<li><strong>Control who can message:</strong> Settings → Privacy → Messages → set to "People you follow"</li>
				<li><strong>Disable activity status:</strong> Settings → Privacy → Activity Status (OFF)</li>
				<li><strong>Control story sharing:</strong> Settings → Privacy → Story → Hide story from specific people</li>
				<li><strong>Restrict comments:</strong> Settings → Privacy → Comments → Manual Filter (add inappropriate words)</li>
				<li><strong>Disable tagging:</strong> Settings → Privacy → Tags → Manually Approve Tags</li>
				<li><strong>Turn off sensitive content:</strong> Settings → Account → Sensitive Content Control → Limit</li>
			</ol>

			<h4>Parental Supervision Tools</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Supervision feature:</strong> Instagram now offers parental supervision tools (set time limits, see who they follow)</li>
				<li><strong>Request to follow:</strong> If private, you must be approved to see their content</li>
				<li><strong>Regular check-ins:</strong> Review DMs, followers, and content together monthly</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Red Flags to Watch For</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Followers who are significantly older or unknown</li>
				<li>Following accounts with inappropriate content</li>
				<li>Posting revealing photos or location information</li>
				<li>Sudden changes in mood after using Instagram</li>
				<li>Secretive about content or conversations</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div class="bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800 border-2 border-blue-200 dark:border-blue-700 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
			<h3>TikTok (ByteDance)</h3>
			<p><strong>Minimum Age:</strong> 13+ | <strong>Primary Risk:</strong> Addictive algorithm, dangerous challenges, adult content exposure</p>

			<h4>How TikTok Works</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Short-form video platform (15 seconds to 10 minutes)</li>
				<li>Extremely powerful algorithm learns preferences quickly</li>
				<li>For You Page (FYP) shows endless stream of videos</li>
				<li>Direct messaging and duets/stitches with other users</li>
				<li>Trends and challenges spread virally</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Key Dangers</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Addictive design:</strong> Scroll time averages 52 minutes per day (teens often much higher)</li>
				<li><strong>Inappropriate content:</strong> Sexual content, violence, drug use slip through filters</li>
				<li><strong>Dangerous challenges:</strong> Viral challenges that cause injury or legal trouble</li>
				<li><strong>Data privacy:</strong> Chinese company with data concerns</li>
				<li><strong>Predators:</strong> Easy for adults to contact minors through comments/DMs</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Essential Privacy Settings</h4>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Private account:</strong> Settings → Privacy → Private Account (ON)</li>
				<li><strong>Restrict DMs:</strong> Settings → Privacy → Messages → "Friends only"</li>
				<li><strong>Comments:</strong> Settings → Privacy → Comments → "Friends only"</li>
				<li><strong>Duet/Stitch:</strong> Settings → Privacy → Duet/Stitch → "Friends only" or OFF</li>
				<li><strong>Disable downloads:</strong> Settings → Privacy → Downloads → OFF</li>
				<li><strong>Suggest account to others:</strong> Settings → Privacy → Suggest account to others (OFF)</li>
				<li><strong>Family Pairing:</strong> Enable parental controls through Family Pairing feature</li>
			</ol>

			<h4>Family Pairing (Parental Controls)</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Set daily screen time limits</li>
				<li>Restrict inappropriate content</li>
				<li>Disable direct messages entirely</li>
				<li>Control privacy settings remotely</li>
				<li>See how much time they're spending</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Conversations to Have</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>"Just because it's a trend doesn't mean you should do it"</li>
				<li>"Videos can be edited - don't compare your life to what you see"</li>
				<li>"The algorithm is designed to keep you watching - set time limits"</li>
				<li>"Never participate in challenges that involve danger, law-breaking, or hurting others"</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div class="bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800 border-2 border-blue-200 dark:border-blue-700 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
			<h3>Snapchat (Snap Inc.)</h3>
			<p><strong>Minimum Age:</strong> 13+ | <strong>Primary Risk:</strong> Disappearing messages, location sharing, false sense of privacy</p>

			<h4>How Snapchat Works</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Messages and photos "disappear" after viewing (but can be screenshot)</li>
				<li>Snap Map shows real-time locations of friends</li>
				<li>Stories visible for 24 hours</li>
				<li>Streak feature encourages daily use</li>
				<li>Discover feed with media content</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Key Dangers</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>False privacy:</strong> Disappearing messages create illusion of no consequences</li>
				<li><strong>Sexting:</strong> Platform most associated with inappropriate photo sharing</li>
				<li><strong>Location tracking:</strong> Snap Map can reveal exact location in real-time</li>
				<li><strong>Screenshots:</strong> Recipients can screenshot before disappearing</li>
				<li><strong>Inappropriate content:</strong> Discover feed often has mature content</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Essential Privacy Settings</h4>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Who can contact me:</strong> Settings → Contact Me → "My Friends" only</li>
				<li><strong>View my story:</strong> Settings → View My Story → "My Friends" only</li>
				<li><strong>See my location:</strong> Settings → See My Location → "Only Me" (Ghost Mode)</li>
				<li><strong>See me in Quick Add:</strong> Settings → See Me in Quick Add (OFF)</li>
				<li><strong>Restrict sensitive content:</strong> Settings → Content Preferences</li>
			</ol>

			<h4>Snap Map Safety</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Turn on "Ghost Mode" so no one can see location</li>
				<li>If sharing location, only share with specific trusted friends</li>
				<li>Never share location publicly</li>
				<li>Explain that location sharing can put them in danger</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>The "Streak" Problem</h4>
			<p>Streaks (consecutive days of snapping) create compulsive behavior. Teens feel obligated to snap daily just to maintain the number, even when they don't want to. This can lead to anxiety and addiction.</p>

			<h4>Parental Monitoring</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Family Center:</strong> Snapchat's parental control feature (see friends list, report concerns)</li>
				<li><strong>Cannot view messages:</strong> Parents cannot see disappearing messages (by design)</li>
				<li><strong>Regular talks:</strong> Must rely on trust and communication</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div class="bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800 border-2 border-blue-200 dark:border-blue-700 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
			<h3>Discord</h3>
			<p><strong>Minimum Age:</strong> 13+ (17+ for some servers) | <strong>Primary Risk:</strong> Unmoderated servers, predators, adult content</p>

			<h4>How Discord Works</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Originally for gamers, now general communication platform</li>
				<li>Server-based (like private chat rooms) with text, voice, and video</li>
				<li>Anyone can create a server and invite others</li>
				<li>Direct messaging between users</li>
				<li>Servers can have thousands of strangers</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Key Dangers</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Unmoderated servers:</strong> Minimal content moderation on private servers</li>
				<li><strong>Predator grooming:</strong> Adults creating servers to target teens</li>
				<li><strong>Explicit content:</strong> NSFW (Not Safe For Work) servers with pornography</li>
				<li><strong>Radicalization:</strong> Extremist groups recruiting in certain servers</li>
				<li><strong>Scams and hacking:</strong> Phishing links and account theft</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Essential Privacy Settings</h4>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Privacy & Safety:</strong> User Settings → Privacy & Safety → Safe Direct Messaging (ON)</li>
				<li><strong>Friend requests:</strong> Privacy & Safety → "Friends of friends" or turn OFF entirely</li>
				<li><strong>DMs from server members:</strong> Right-click server → Privacy Settings → Direct Messages (OFF)</li>
				<li><strong>Explicit content filter:</strong> Privacy & Safety → Explicit Image Filter → "Keep me safe" or "My friends are nice"</li>
			</ol>

			<h4>Server Safety Rules</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Only join servers for games/topics they actually participate in</li>
				<li>Never join servers found through invites from strangers</li>
				<li>Leave immediately if server has inappropriate content</li>
				<li>Understand that server owners can see all messages</li>
				<li>Use a username that doesn't reveal identity</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Parental Oversight</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>No built-in parental controls</li>
				<li>Review server list together regularly</li>
				<li>Require that you approve all servers before joining</li>
				<li>Consider only allowing use for specific purposes (schoolwork, known gaming groups)</li>
			</ul>

			<div class="alert alert-warning">
				<strong>High Risk:</strong> Discord is one of the platforms most frequently used by predators to groom minors. Requires very close supervision.
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800 border-2 border-blue-200 dark:border-blue-700 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
			<h3>YouTube</h3>
			<p><strong>Minimum Age:</strong> 13+ (YouTube Kids for younger) | <strong>Primary Risk:</strong> Algorithm rabbit holes, inappropriate content, comments</p>

			<h4>Key Dangers</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Algorithm manipulation:</strong> Can lead to increasingly extreme content</li>
				<li><strong>Inappropriate content:</strong> Mature content not always flagged</li>
				<li><strong>Comments section:</strong> Toxic, bullying, and inappropriate comments</li>
				<li><strong>Predators:</strong> Targeting young creators through comments</li>
				<li><strong>Time consumption:</strong> Autoplay keeps videos running indefinitely</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Safety Settings</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Enable <a href="/guides/safe-search">Restricted Mode</a></li>
				<li>Use <a href="/guides/youtube-filtering">Supervised Google Account</a> for full control</li>

		<h2>⚠️ Universal Social Media Risks</h2>

		<div class="bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800 border-2 border-blue-200 dark:border-blue-700 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
			<h3>Cyberbullying</h3>
			<p>Mean comments, exclusion from groups, spreading rumors, sharing embarrassing photos. More prevalent and harmful than in-person bullying because it's public, permanent, and inescapable.</p>
			<p><strong>Prevention:</strong> Private accounts, limiting followers, blocking bullies immediately, documenting evidence. See our <a href="/guides/cyberbullying">Cyberbullying Guide</a>.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800 border-2 border-blue-200 dark:border-blue-700 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
			<h3>Mental Health Impacts</h3>
			<p>Studies link heavy social media use to anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, sleep problems, and body image issues. Comparison culture ("everyone else's life looks perfect") affects emotional well-being.</p>
			<p><strong>Prevention:</strong> <a href="/guides/screen-time-management">Time limits</a>, tech-free zones, regular check-ins about feelings, following positive/educational accounts.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800 border-2 border-blue-200 dark:border-blue-700 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
			<h3>Predators & Grooming</h3>
			<p>Adults creating fake accounts to befriend minors, gradually building trust to manipulate into inappropriate conversations or meetings.</p>
			<p><strong>Warning signs:</strong> New "friend" who is overly interested, asks personal questions, wants to move to private messaging, offers gifts/money, asks to keep relationship secret.</p>
			<p><strong>Prevention:</strong> Private accounts, only accepting known friends, never meeting online friends in person without parent supervision.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800 border-2 border-blue-200 dark:border-blue-700 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
			<h3>Sextortion</h3>
			<p>Someone convinces teen to send inappropriate photo, then threatens to share it unless they send more/send money. FBI reports this as rapidly growing crime against minors.</p>
			<p><strong>Prevention:</strong> "Never send photos you wouldn't want your grandmother to see." Once sent, you lose control forever.</p>
			<p><strong>If it happens:</strong> Do not send more. Document everything. Report to FBI at ic3.gov. It's not the teen's fault - the blackmailer is the criminal.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800 border-2 border-blue-200 dark:border-blue-700 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
			<h3>Digital Footprint & Future Consequences</h3>
			<p>Posts from age 13 can affect college admissions and job prospects at age 22. Screenshots live forever even if original is deleted.</p>
			<p><strong>Prevention:</strong> "Post as if your future employer will see it" rule. Think before posting.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800 border-2 border-blue-200 dark:border-blue-700 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
			<h3>Addiction & Time Consumption</h3>
			<p>Apps are intentionally designed by behavior psychologists to be addictive. Infinite scroll, notifications, FOMO (fear of missing out), and intermittent rewards create compulsive use.</p>
			<p><strong>Prevention:</strong> Use built-in screen time limits, turn off notifications, phone-free times (meals, bedtime, homework), grayscale mode, app time restrictions.</p>

			<li>When drama happens: "This is why digital communication can escalate - tone is hard to read"</li>
			<li>When comparing to others: "Remember, people post highlights, not reality"</li>
