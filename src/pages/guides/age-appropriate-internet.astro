    <h2>Why Age-Appropriate Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Just as you wouldn't hand car keys to a 10-year-old, children need age-appropriate access to the internet. Their
      cognitive development, emotional maturity, and ability to understand consequences vary dramatically across
      childhood. A staged approach builds digital literacy while protecting them from content and situations they're not
      ready to handle.
    </p>

    <div class="alert alert-success">
      <strong>Key Principle:</strong> Start with maximum supervision and simple devices, gradually expanding access and independence
      as your child demonstrates responsibility and maturity.
