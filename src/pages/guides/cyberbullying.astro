		<h2>Understanding Cyberbullying</h2>
		<p>
			Cyberbullying is bullying that takes place using electronic technology - social media, messaging apps, gaming platforms, and phones. Unlike traditional bullying that might end when the school day ends, cyberbullying is relentless, following victims home and often becoming visible to a wide audience. The digital nature makes it more damaging: it's permanent (screenshots last forever), public (humiliation is amplified), and inescapable (24/7 access).
		</p>

		<div class="alert alert-warning">
			<strong>Statistics:</strong> 59% of US teens have experienced some form of cyberbullying. Only 1 in 10 victims tell a parent. Cyberbullying victims are 2-9 times more likely to consider suicide than non-victims.

		</div>

	<section>
		<h2>üõ°Ô∏è Prevention Strategies</h2>

		<h3>Create Open Communication</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Talk early and often:</strong> Discuss cyberbullying before it happens</li>
			<li><strong>Create safe space:</strong> "You won't get in trouble for telling me about problems"</li>
			<li><strong>Regular check-ins:</strong> "Has anyone been mean to you or your friends online?"</li>
			<li><strong>Listen without judging:</strong> Don't immediately react with anger or blame</li>
			<li><strong>Validate feelings:</strong> "That sounds really hurtful" rather than "Just ignore it"</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Teach Digital Citizenship</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The "Grandma Rule": Don't post anything you wouldn't want grandma to see</li>
			<li>Think before you post - consider how words might be received</li>
			<li>Be a helpful bystander - support victims, don't pile on</li>
			<li>Understand that tone is hard to convey in text</li>
			<li>Once posted, it's permanent - even if deleted</li>
			<li>Treat others online as you would face-to-face</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Technical Safeguards</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Privacy settings:</strong> Keep all accounts private, friends-only</li>
			<li><strong>Approve followers:</strong> Only people they know in real life</li>
			<li><strong>Limit comments:</strong> Friends only or disable entirely</li>
			<li><strong>Location sharing:</strong> Turn off geotagging and location services</li>
			<li><strong>Regular reviews:</strong> Check followers, friend lists, and messages together</li>
			<li><strong>Use real names:</strong> Makes people think twice before being cruel</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Build Resilience</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Foster offline friendships and activities</li>
			<li>Build strong sense of self-worth (not dependent on likes/followers)</li>
			<li>Develop coping skills for dealing with conflict</li>
			<li>Maintain balance - online is not real life</li>
			<li>Encourage activities where they excel and feel confident</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>üì± When Cyberbullying Happens: Immediate Response</h2>

		<h3>Step 1: Stay Calm & Listen</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Thank them for telling you</li>
			<li>Listen without interrupting or minimizing</li>
			<li>Avoid immediate reactions like "Let me call that kid's mother!"</li>
			<li>Don't blame them or suggest they provoked it</li>
			<li>Ask open-ended questions: "Tell me what happened"</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Step 2: Document Everything</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Screenshots:</strong> Capture messages, posts, comments with dates/times</li>
			<li><strong>Save messages:</strong> Don't delete evidence</li>
			<li><strong>Print copies:</strong> Digital evidence can disappear</li>
			<li><strong>Record details:</strong> Dates, times, usernames, witnesses</li>
			<li><strong>Note impact:</strong> How it's affecting your child (evidence for school/police)</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Step 3: Block & Report</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Block the bully:</strong> On all platforms where harassment occurs</li>
			<li><strong>Report to platform:</strong> Use built-in reporting features</li>
			<li><strong>Report to school:</strong> If it involves classmates (even if outside school hours)</li>
			<li><strong>Don't respond:</strong> Engaging often escalates the situation</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Step 4: Assess Severity</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Mild:</strong> Mean comments, temporary exclusion ‚Üí Block, monitor, talk through feelings</li>
			<li><strong>Moderate:</strong> Persistent harassment, rumors, impersonation ‚Üí Involve school, document, consider counseling</li>
			<li><strong>Severe:</strong> Threats, explicit images, physical threats, suicidal ideation ‚Üí Involve police immediately</li>
		</ul>

		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<strong>Don't retaliate:</strong> Responding with more cyberbullying makes the situation worse and can make your child look like the aggressor.

		<h2>üíô Supporting Your Child Emotionally</h2>

		<h3>Validate Their Feelings</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>"I'm so sorry this is happening to you"</li>
			<li>"This is not your fault"</li>
			<li>"You were right to tell me"</li>
			<li>"I believe you"</li>
			<li>"What you're feeling is completely normal"</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Provide Practical Support</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Help them block and report</li>
			<li>Take screenshots for documentation</li>
			<li>Accompany them to meet with school officials</li>
			<li>Connect them with counselor or therapist</li>
			<li>Maintain normal routines and activities</li>
			<li>Encourage offline friendships</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>What NOT to Say</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>‚ùå "Just ignore it" (minimizes their pain)</li>
			<li>‚ùå "What did you do to cause this?" (victim-blaming)</li>
			<li>‚ùå "Kids will be kids" (dismissive)</li>
			<li>‚ùå "You're too sensitive" (invalidating)</li>
			<li>‚ùå "Delete your account" (punishing the victim)</li>
			<li>‚ùå "I'm taking away all your devices" (isolates them further)</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Signs They Need Professional Help</h3>

			<li>Self-harm or suicidal thoughts</li>
			<li>Significant changes in eating or sleeping</li>

		</div>

	<section>
		<h2>ü§ù The Role of Bystanders</h2>
		<p>Teach your child to be an "upstander" not a bystander:</p>

		<h3>What Upstanders Can Do</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Don't participate:</strong> Don't like, share, or comment on cruel posts</li>
			<li><strong>Support the victim privately:</strong> "That was really mean. Are you okay?"</li>
			<li><strong>Report to adults:</strong> "This is happening and it's not okay"</li>
			<li><strong>Change the subject:</strong> In group chats, redirect conversation</li>
			<li><strong>Defend publicly (if safe):</strong> "That's not cool" or "Leave them alone"</li>
			<li><strong>Document:</strong> Screenshot evidence if victim is too upset</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Why Bystanders Matter</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Bullying often stops when peers intervene</li>
			<li>Support from classmates helps victims recover faster</li>
			<li>Speaking up creates a culture where bullying isn't tolerated</li>
			<li>Silent witnesses enable bullies</li>
