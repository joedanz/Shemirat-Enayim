    <h2>Why Online Gaming Requires Special Attention</h2>
    <p>
      Online gaming is no longer a solitary activity - it's a social ecosystem where millions of players interact in
      real-time. While gaming can build problem-solving skills and friendships, it also creates risks: exposure to
      strangers, inappropriate language, predatory behavior, cyberbullying, addictive mechanics, and unexpected costs.
      Unlike social media where parents might see posts, gaming conversations happen in voice chat and disappear, making
      supervision more challenging.
    </p>

    <div class="alert alert-info">
      <strong>Key Fact:</strong> 75% of children ages 9-12 play online games. 41% of online gamers have experienced harassment
      while playing. Understanding the risks is essential for modern parenting.

    <h2>💬 Voice Chat Safety Rules</h2>
    <p>Voice chat presents unique risks because conversations disappear and parents can't easily review them.</p>

    <h3>For Younger Children (Under 13)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Disable voice chat entirely</li>
      <li>If allowing, only with known real-life friends</li>
      <li>Headphones on speaker mode so you can hear conversations</li>
      <li>Gaming in common areas where you can listen</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For Teens (13+)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Party chat with friends only (not public lobbies)</li>
      <li>Mute all except known friends</li>
      <li>Never share personal information over voice chat</li>
      <li>Report abusive players immediately</li>
      <li>Don't engage with toxic players - mute them</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Red Flags in Voice Chat</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Adults asking personal questions (age, location, school)</li>
      <li>Requests to move to private Discord server or other platform</li>
      <li>Gift-giving or offers of free in-game items</li>
      <li>Asking to keep friendship secret from parents</li>
      <li>Sexual language or requests for pictures</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="alert alert-warning">
      <strong>Warning:</strong> Many predators use voice chat in games to build trust with children before moving to private
      messaging platforms. Teach children to tell you immediately if anyone makes them uncomfortable.
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>💰 Managing In-Game Purchases</h2>

    <h3>Types of In-Game Purchases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cosmetics:</strong> Character skins, outfits, emotes (no gameplay advantage)</li>
      <li><strong>Currency:</strong> V-Bucks, Robux, etc. for buying items</li>
      <li><strong>Battle Passes:</strong> Seasonal progression systems ($10-20 per season)</li>
      <li><strong>Loot Boxes:</strong> Random rewards (gambling-like mechanics)</li>
      <li><strong>Pay-to-Win:</strong> Items that give gameplay advantages</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Protection Strategies</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Remove payment methods:</strong> Don't store credit cards on gaming accounts</li>
      <li><strong>Use gift cards only:</strong> Limited, predetermined amount</li>
      <li><strong>Require approval:</strong> Password/PIN for all purchases</li>
      <li><strong>Set spending limits:</strong> Console features allow monthly limits</li>
      <li><strong>Allowance system:</strong> "Earn" in-game currency through chores/good behavior</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Teaching Financial Responsibility</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Explain that free games make money through purchases (business model)</li>
      <li>Discuss how games create FOMO with limited-time items</li>
      <li>Compare virtual purchases to real-world value ($20 skin = 2 movie tickets)</li>
      <li>Teach delayed gratification - wait 24 hours before buying</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="alert alert-info">
      <strong>Loot Box Warning:</strong> Many countries are considering loot boxes as gambling. They exploit children's developing
      brains with random rewards. Avoid games heavily focused on loot boxes.
