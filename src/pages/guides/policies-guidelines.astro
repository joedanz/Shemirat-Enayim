		<h2>Why Written Policies Matter</h2>
		<p>
			Clear, written policies protect both your organization and your community members. They set expectations, provide legal protection, guide staff responses to incidents, and demonstrate due diligence. Without policies, responses become inconsistent, liability increases, and confusion reigns. This guide provides templates you can adapt to your institution's needs and values.
