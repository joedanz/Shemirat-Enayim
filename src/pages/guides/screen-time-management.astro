		<h2>Why Screen Time Management Matters</h2>
		<p>
			Excessive screen time is linked to sleep problems, obesity, behavioral issues, academic decline, anxiety, depression, and reduced social skills. The average child spends 5-7 hours per day on screens (not including homework), far exceeding recommended limits. However, not all screen time is equal - educational content, video calls with family, and creative activities are different from mindless scrolling or violent games. The goal isn't to eliminate screens, but to create intentional, balanced use.
		</p>

		<div class="alert alert-warning">
			<strong>Important:</strong> Before setting limits for children, audit your own screen time. Children model what they see. If you're constantly on your phone, your rules will lack credibility.
		</div>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>üìä Recommended Screen Time Limits by Age</h2>
		<p>Based on American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines:</p>

		<div class="guidelines-table">
			<table class="w-full border-collapse bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg overflow-hidden shadow-md text-sm">
				<tr>
					<th>Age</th>
					<th>Recommended Limit</th>
					<th>Notes</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><strong>Under 18 months</strong></td>
					<td>No screen time (except video chat)</td>
					<td>Critical brain development period</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><strong>18-24 months</strong></td>
					<td>Limited, high-quality programming only</td>
					<td>Co-view and discuss content</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><strong>2-5 years</strong></td>
					<td>1 hour per day maximum</td>
					<td>High-quality educational content, with parent present</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><strong>6-12 years</strong></td>
					<td>1-2 hours per day</td>
					<td>Prioritize homework, physical activity, sleep</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><strong>13-18 years</strong></td>
					<td>2 hours recreational (not including homework)</td>
					<td>Emphasize self-regulation and balance</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<strong>Context matters:</strong> These are recreational screen time limits. Educational screen time (homework, research) is separate. Video calling grandparents is different from YouTube browsing. Quality and context matter as much as quantity.
		</div>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>üéØ Quality vs. Quantity</h2>
		<p>Not all screen time is created equal. Consider both time AND content:</p>

		<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 my-6">
			<div class="quality-card positive">
				<h3>‚úÖ Higher Quality Screen Time</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Educational content (Khan Academy, documentaries)</li>
					<li>Creative activities (coding, digital art, music production)</li>
					<li>Social connection (video calls with family/friends)</li>
					<li>Reading ebooks</li>
					<li>Homework and research</li>
					<li>Learning new skills (language apps, tutorials)</li>
					<li>Co-viewing and discussing with parents</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="quality-card negative">
				<h3>‚ö†Ô∏è Lower Quality Screen Time</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Mindless scrolling through social media</li>
					<li>Binge-watching without purpose</li>
					<li>Auto-play content consumption</li>
					<li>Violent or inappropriate content</li>
					<li>Advertising-heavy "free" games</li>
					<li>Isolated, passive consumption</li>
					<li>Late-night screen use affecting sleep</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
		</div>

		<p><strong>The 80/20 approach:</strong> Aim for 80% purposeful, high-quality screen time and 20% entertainment/relaxation. This creates balance without being overly restrictive.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>üè† Creating Screen-Free Zones and Times</h2>

		<h3>Screen-Free Zones (Where)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Bedrooms:</strong> No devices in rooms overnight (affects sleep)</li>
			<li><strong>Dining table:</strong> Family meals without screens</li>
			<li><strong>Kitchen:</strong> During cooking and eating</li>
			<li><strong>Car:</strong> Use drive time for conversation</li>
			<li><strong>Bathroom:</strong> No phones in the bathroom</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Screen-Free Times (When)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>First hour of morning:</strong> Start day without screens</li>
			<li><strong>During meals:</strong> All family meals screen-free</li>
			<li><strong>One hour before bed:</strong> Blue light affects sleep</li>
			<li><strong>During homework:</strong> (except when needed for work)</li>
			<li><strong>Family activities:</strong> Game night, outings, conversations</li>
			<li><strong>One full day per week:</strong> "Tech Sabbath" or screen-free Sunday</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Creating a "Device Parking Lot"</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Designate a central location for charging devices overnight</li>
			<li>Use a basket, drawer, or charging station in parent's room or common area</li>
			<li>All devices (including parents') go there at bedtime</li>
			<li>Buy alarm clocks so phones aren't needed in bedrooms</li>
		</ul>

		<div class="alert alert-success">
			<strong>Tip:</strong> Apply screen-free zones and times to the WHOLE family, including parents. This eliminates the "Why do you get to use your phone at dinner?" arguments.
		</div>

		<h2>‚è∞ Implementing Time Limits</h2>

		<h3>Using Built-in Parental Controls</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>iOS:</strong> <a href="/guides/ios-screen-time">Screen Time</a> - Set daily limits per app category, downtime schedules</li>
			<li><strong>Android:</strong> <a href="/guides/android-family-link">Family Link</a> - App time limits, daily limit, bedtime schedule</li>
			<li><strong>Windows:</strong> Microsoft Family Safety - Screen time limits, daily reports</li>
			<li><strong>macOS:</strong> Screen Time - Similar to iOS</li>
			<li><strong>Gaming consoles:</strong> PlayStation, Xbox, Switch all have time limit features</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Token/Ticket System (for Younger Kids)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Give child daily "screen time tokens" (physical or visual)</li>
			<li>Each token = 30 minutes of screen time</li>
			<li>Child chooses when to "spend" tokens throughout the day</li>
			<li>Teaches self-regulation and decision-making</li>
			<li>Can earn extra tokens for chores or good behavior</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Natural Consequences Approach (for Teens)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Set overall weekly screen time budget (e.g., 15 hours)</li>
			<li>Teen manages their own time within that budget</li>
			<li>If they blow through it in 3 days, no more for the week</li>
			<li>Teaches time management and consequences</li>
			<li>Requires maturity and trust</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>The "Earn It" System</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Screen time is earned, not a right</li>
			<li>Homework completed = unlocks screens</li>
			<li>Chores done = screen time available</li>
			<li>30 minutes of reading = 30 minutes of screens</li>
			<li>30 minutes outside = 1 hour of gaming</li>
		</ul>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>üì± Managing Specific Scenarios</h2>

		<h3>Homework on Devices</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Use website blockers to allow only educational sites</li>
			<li>Set device in common area during homework time</li>
			<li>Use "Work Mode" browser extensions that limit distractions</li>
			<li>Check in periodically - are they actually on task?</li>
			<li>Set timer - homework shouldn't take 4 hours on a computer</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Weekends vs. Weekdays</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Weekdays: Stricter limits (1-2 hours after responsibilities)</li>
			<li>Weekends: More flexible (2-3 hours), but not unlimited</li>
			<li>Require at least 1 hour outdoors or physical activity first</li>
			<li>Balance screen time with family activities</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Summer and School Breaks</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Don't let limits completely disappear</li>
			<li>Create structure: "Screens available after lunch"</li>
			<li>Enroll in camps, activities, sports to provide alternatives</li>
			<li>Reading challenges or project goals before screen time</li>
			<li>More flexibility but still boundaries</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Social Pressure ("Everyone Else Gets To...")</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>"I'm sure it feels that way, but not everyone..."</li>
			<li>"Different families have different rules"</li>
			<li>"Our family values include balance"</li>
			<li>Offer compromises: Friend can come over for limited screen time together</li>
			<li>Stand firm - peer pressure isn't a reason to abandon limits</li>
		</ul>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>üåü Providing Alternatives to Screens</h2>
		<p>The key to reducing screen time is providing appealing alternatives:</p>

		<h3>For Younger Children (5-10)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Arts and crafts supplies readily available</li>
			<li>Board games and puzzles</li>
			<li>Outdoor toys (bikes, balls, sidewalk chalk)</li>
			<li>Building sets (Lego, blocks)</li>
			<li>Books at their reading level</li>
			<li>Musical instruments</li>
			<li>Play dates with friends</li>
			<li>Cooking/baking together</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>For Tweens (11-13)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Sports teams or lessons</li>
			<li>Hobby supplies (art, music, crafts)</li>
			<li>Books (series they love)</li>
			<li>Volunteer opportunities</li>
			<li>Part-time job (dog walking, babysitting)</li>
			<li>Youth groups or clubs</li>
			<li>Family game nights</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>For Teens (14+)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Driver's ed and driving practice</li>
			<li>Part-time job</li>
			<li>Exercise/gym membership</li>
			<li>Social activities with friends</li>
			<li>Passion projects (starting a business, podcast, blog)</li>
			<li>Community service</li>
			<li>Learning practical skills (cooking, car maintenance)</li>
		</ul>

		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<strong>Combat boredom:</strong> When kids say "I'm bored," resist the urge to hand them a screen. Boredom is healthy - it sparks creativity and imagination. Keep a "Boredom Buster" jar with activity ideas they can pull from.

		<h2>üí° Enforcement Strategies</h2>

		<h3>Make Rules Clear and Consistent</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Write down rules and post them visibly</li>
			<li>Explain the "why" behind each rule</li>
			<li>Apply rules consistently (same consequence every time)</li>
			<li>Both parents must enforce same rules</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Give Warnings Before Time is Up</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>"15 minutes left" warning prevents meltdowns</li>
			<li>"5 minutes - save your game now"</li>
			<li>Use timers that child can see</li>
			<li>Don't interrupt mid-activity without warning</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Follow Through on Consequences</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>If you threaten to take the device, do it</li>
			<li>Don't make threats you won't enforce</li>
			<li>Be calm and matter-of-fact, not angry</li>
			<li>"You went over time, so the iPad is gone for 24 hours"</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Use Technology to Enforce</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Parental controls automatically enforce limits</li>
			<li>Removes parent from being the "bad guy"</li>
			<li>"The device says your time is up" vs. "I'm taking it away"</li>
			<li>Less room for negotiation and arguing</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Positive Reinforcement</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Praise when they stop willingly</li>
			<li>"I really appreciate you turning it off right away"</li>
			<li>Extra time as reward for good behavior</li>
			<li>Recognize when they self-regulate</li>
		</ul>
