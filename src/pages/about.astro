        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-6">Who We Are</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          We are a group of concerned parents who understand the challenges of raising children in today's digital age.
          Like you, we've struggled with finding the right balance between giving our children access to the incredible
          educational and practical benefits of the internet while protecting them from its very real dangers.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Through our own experiences—both successes and setbacks—we've learned valuable lessons about internet
          filtering, parental controls, and creating healthy digital boundaries within Orthodox Jewish homes. We created
          this resource to share what we've learned with other parents facing similar challenges.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-6">Our Mission</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Our mission is simple: to empower parents with practical, actionable information about internet safety and
          filtering solutions. We believe that when parents are equipped with the right knowledge and tools, they can
          make informed decisions that best serve their family's unique needs and values.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          We're not affiliated with any particular filtering service or product. Our goal is to provide objective
          information, honest reviews, and real-world guidance based on our collective experiences as parents navigating
          these same waters.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-6">Why We Do This</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The internet has become an unavoidable part of modern life. Whether for school assignments, staying connected
          with family, or accessing essential services, complete digital isolation is often neither practical nor
          beneficial. Yet the risks—from inappropriate content to privacy concerns to the impacts on mental health—are
          significant and well-documented.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          We've seen too many families struggle in silence, not knowing where to turn for guidance. We've witnessed the
          confusion that comes from conflicting advice, technical jargon, and the overwhelming number of filtering
          options available. And we've experienced firsthand the peace of mind that comes from having a well-implemented
          filtering strategy.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          This website exists because we wish we had a resource like this when we first started our own journey toward
          digital safety. We hope that by sharing our knowledge openly, we can help other parents feel less alone and
          more confident in their ability to protect their children online.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-6">Our Approach</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          We recognize that every family is different. What works for one household may not work for another. That's why
          we focus on providing comprehensive information rather than prescriptive solutions. We present various
          options, explain the pros and cons of different approaches, and offer guidance to help you make the best
          choices for your specific situation.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          We're also committed to keeping our information up-to-date. Technology changes rapidly, and filtering
          solutions evolve constantly. We regularly review and update our guides to ensure they reflect current best
          practices and available options.
