				<h2 class="section-title">General Questions</h2>
				<div class="accordion-list">
					<Accordion title="Is internet filtering really necessary?">
						<p>
							Yes, internet filtering is crucial for protecting families from harmful content. Studies show that 95% of children
							ages 8-16 have encountered inappropriate material online, often accidentally. Filtering provides multiple layers
							of protection and helps create healthy digital boundaries.
						</p>
						<p>
							However, filtering should be combined with education, open communication, and trust-building for maximum effectiveness.
						</p>
					</Accordion>

					<Accordion title="How much does internet filtering cost?">
						<p>There are solutions at every price point:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Free:</strong> DNS filtering (OpenDNS FamilyShield, CleanBrowsing), built-in device controls (iOS Screen Time, Android Family Link)</li>
							<li><strong>$0-50/year:</strong> Premium DNS services with custom filtering</li>
							<li><strong>$50-100/year:</strong> Filtering software like Qustodio, Net Nanny (5-10 devices)</li>
							<li><strong>$100+/year:</strong> Accountability apps (Covenant Eyes), enterprise solutions for institutions</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Many families find that combining free DNS filtering with built-in device controls provides excellent protection
							without any cost.
						</p>
					</Accordion>

					<Accordion title="Can tech-savvy kids bypass filters?">
						<p>
							While no solution is 100% bypass-proof, layered protection makes bypassing extremely difficult:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Network-level DNS filtering blocks attempts across all devices</li>
							<li>Router-level controls prevent DNS server changes</li>
							<li>Device-level restrictions require passwords to modify settings</li>
							<li>Monitoring software alerts you to bypass attempts</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							The goal isn't to create an impenetrable fortress, but to make accessing inappropriate content difficult enough
							that it's not worth the effort. Most importantly, build trust and maintain open communication about why
							protection exists.
						</p>
					</Accordion>

					<Accordion title="Will filtering slow down my internet?">
						<p>
							Modern filtering solutions have minimal impact on internet speed:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>DNS filtering:</strong> Adds 1-5ms latency (imperceptible to users)</li>
							<li><strong>Software filtering:</strong> Uses &lt;2% CPU on modern devices</li>
							<li><strong>Router controls:</strong> No noticeable impact with current-generation routers</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							If you experience significant slowdowns, it's usually due to misconfiguration rather than the filtering itself.
							Check our <a href="/troubleshooting/slow-internet">slow internet troubleshooting guide</a> for solutions.
						</p>
					</Accordion>

					<Accordion title="What's the difference between filtering and monitoring?">
						<p>
							<strong>Filtering</strong> proactively blocks access to inappropriate content before it can be viewed. Think
							of it like a fence that prevents entry to dangerous areas.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Monitoring</strong> tracks and reports internet activity after it happens, allowing you to see what
							was accessed. Think of it like a security camera recording what happens.
						</p>
						<p>
							The most effective approach combines both: filtering to prevent most issues, and monitoring to catch what slips through and address patterns of concern.
						</p>
					</Accordion>

					<Accordion title="At what age should I introduce internet access?">
						<p>
							Age recommendations vary by device type:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Ages 3-5:</strong> Supervised tablet use with dedicated kids' apps only</li>
							<li><strong>Ages 6-9:</strong> Supervised computer/tablet use, no smartphone</li>
							<li><strong>Ages 10-12:</strong> Basic phone for communication, heavily filtered</li>
							<li><strong>Ages 13-15:</strong> Smartphone with strong filtering and monitoring</li>
							<li><strong>Ages 16+:</strong> Gradual removal of restrictions as maturity increases</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							These are guidelines, not rules. Every child develops differently. See our
							<a href="/guides/age-appropriate-internet">age-appropriate internet guide</a> for detailed recommendations.
						</p>
					</Accordion>

					<Accordion title="Do I need to tell my kids about the filtering?">
						<p>
							<strong>Yes, transparency is crucial.</strong> Hidden monitoring damages trust and can backfire when discovered.
						</p>
						<p>
							Instead, frame it positively:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>"We use filtering to protect our family, just like we lock doors and wear seatbelts"</li>
							<li>"These tools help us all make better choices online"</li>
							<li>"As you demonstrate maturity, we'll gradually adjust the restrictions"</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Explain that protection exists because you care about their wellbeing, not because you don't trust them.
						</p>
					</Accordion>

					<Accordion title="Is filtering an invasion of privacy?">
						<p>
							For minors, parental oversight is responsible guardianship, not privacy invasion. Courts consistently uphold
							parents' right and responsibility to monitor children's online activity.
						</p>
						<p>
							However, implement filtering with appropriate boundaries:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Be transparent about what's monitored and why</li>
							<li>Respect age-appropriate privacy (don't read every text message to a 16-year-old)</li>
							<li>Focus on patterns and red flags, not micromanaging every interaction</li>
							<li>Gradually reduce monitoring as children demonstrate maturity</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							For adults seeking accountability, voluntary monitoring with a trusted partner is a powerful personal growth tool.
						</p>

				<h2 class="section-title">Technical Questions</h2>
				<div class="accordion-list">
					<Accordion title="What's the difference between DNS filtering and software filtering?">
						<p>
							<strong>DNS filtering</strong> blocks websites by preventing your device from finding their internet address.
							It works at the network level, protecting all devices automatically.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Simple setup, protects all devices, no software to install, free options available</li>
							<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Can be bypassed with VPNs, can't filter HTTPS content, all-or-nothing approach</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							<strong>Software filtering</strong> installs programs on individual devices to analyze and block content in real-time.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Device-specific controls, can filter HTTPS content, includes monitoring features</li>
							<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Requires installation on each device, ongoing subscription costs, can impact performance</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Best practice: Use both. DNS filtering as your network-wide foundation, plus software filtering on key devices
							for granular control.
						</p>
					</Accordion>

					<Accordion title="Why aren't my DNS changes taking effect?">
						<p>
							This is the most common filtering issue. Common causes:
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li><strong>DNS cache:</strong> Your device is still using old DNS information. <a href="/troubleshooting/dns-not-working">Flush your DNS cache</a></li>
							<li><strong>Multiple DNS settings:</strong> DNS set on both router AND device (device wins). Check device settings</li>
							<li><strong>VPN or proxy:</strong> Some apps bypass your DNS settings. Check for VPN apps</li>
							<li><strong>DNS over HTTPS (DoH):</strong> Browsers may bypass system DNS. Disable DoH in browser settings</li>
							<li><strong>Mobile data:</strong> DNS only works on WiFi. Mobile data uses carrier DNS</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							See our complete <a href="/troubleshooting/dns-not-working">DNS troubleshooting guide</a> for step-by-step solutions.
						</p>
					</Accordion>

					<Accordion title="How do I prevent VPN use to bypass filtering?">
						<p>
							VPNs are a common bypass method, but can be blocked:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Router level:</strong> Block known VPN ports (1194, 500, 4500) and protocols</li>
							<li><strong>Device level:</strong> Restrict app installation (iOS Screen Time, Android Family Link)</li>
							<li><strong>DNS level:</strong> Some DNS services (NextDNS, OpenDNS) can block VPN domains</li>
							<li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Software like Bark alerts you when VPN apps are installed</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							For iOS devices, prevent VPN profile installation by enabling "Screen Time" and disallowing "VPN &amp; Device Management"
							configuration changes.
						</p>
					</Accordion>

					<Accordion title="Can filtering work with my mesh WiFi system?">
						<p>
							Yes! Mesh systems (Google WiFi, Eero, Orbi, etc.) fully support filtering:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>DNS filtering:</strong> Set custom DNS on the primary router/gateway (covers all mesh nodes)</li>
							<li><strong>Built-in controls:</strong> Many mesh systems include parental controls (Eero Secure, Google WiFi Family WiFi)</li>
							<li><strong>Guest networks:</strong> Create separate filtered networks for kids' devices</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							The mesh system acts as one unified network, so DNS changes on the main unit protect all connected devices
							automatically.
						</p>
					</Accordion>

					<Accordion title="What is DNS over HTTPS (DoH) and why is it a problem?">
						<p>
							DNS over HTTPS (DoH) encrypts DNS requests, preventing DNS filtering from working. Modern browsers like Chrome,
							Firefox, and Edge increasingly enable DoH by default.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>How to disable DoH:</strong>
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Chrome:</strong> Settings → Privacy → Security → Use secure DNS → Off</li>
							<li><strong>Firefox:</strong> Settings → Privacy → Enable DNS over HTTPS → Off</li>
							<li><strong>Edge:</strong> Settings → Privacy → Security → Use secure DNS → Off</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Advanced option: Use router firewall rules to block DoH providers (Cloudflare 1.1.1.1, Google 8.8.8.8) and force
							traffic through your filtering DNS.
						</p>
					</Accordion>

					<Accordion title="How do I filter YouTube without blocking it entirely?">
						<p>
							YouTube filtering is challenging but achievable:
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li><strong>YouTube Kids:</strong> Separate app with curated content (ages 3-12)</li>
							<li><strong>Restricted Mode:</strong> Built-in filter (imperfect, but free). Lock it with account supervision</li>
							<li><strong>Supervised accounts:</strong> Create child accounts under Family Link (Android) or Screen Time (iOS)</li>
							<li><strong>Browser extensions:</strong> Video Blocker, DF YouTube blocks recommended videos</li>
							<li><strong>Software filtering:</strong> Bark, Qustodio can block specific YouTube channels/keywords</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							Complete guide: <a href="/guides/youtube-filtering">YouTube Filtering Methods</a>
						</p>
					</Accordion>

					<Accordion title="Will filtering work on mobile data or only WiFi?">
						<p>
							<strong>DNS filtering only works on WiFi</strong> because you can't control your mobile carrier's DNS servers.
						</p>
						<p>
							Solutions for mobile data protection:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Device-level controls:</strong> iOS Screen Time and Android Family Link work on both WiFi and cellular</li>
							<li><strong>Carrier family plans:</strong> Verizon Smart Family, AT&amp;T Secure Family add filtering to mobile data</li>
							<li><strong>Filtering apps:</strong> Qustodio, Net Nanny, Bark filter on both WiFi and cellular</li>
							<li><strong>VPN-based filtering:</strong> NextDNS or CleanBrowsing VPN profiles filter all traffic</li>
						</ul>
					</Accordion>

					<Accordion title="Do I need a special router for parental controls?">
						<p>
							No, almost any router can implement DNS filtering by changing its DNS server settings. However, routers with
							built-in parental controls offer additional convenience:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Basic routers:</strong> Can use DNS filtering (requires manual setup)</li>
							<li><strong>Mid-range routers:</strong> Often include basic scheduling and device blocking</li>
							<li><strong>Advanced routers:</strong> ASUS AiProtection, Netgear Armor, TP-Link HomeCare provide comprehensive filtering</li>
							<li><strong>Enterprise routers:</strong> pfSense, OPNsense offer professional-grade filtering</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							If you're buying a new router, look for models with built-in parental controls for easier management.
						</p>
					</Accordion>

					<Accordion title="Can I use multiple filtering methods together?">
						<p>
							Yes! Layered protection is recommended for maximum effectiveness:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Layer 1:</strong> Network-level DNS filtering (protects all devices)</li>
							<li><strong>Layer 2:</strong> Router parental controls (scheduling, device restrictions)</li>
							<li><strong>Layer 3:</strong> Device-level controls (iOS Screen Time, Windows Family Safety)</li>
							<li><strong>Layer 4:</strong> Software filtering on key devices (detailed monitoring)</li>
							<li><strong>Layer 5:</strong> Browser extensions (additional protection)</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Each layer catches what others might miss. If one fails, others provide backup protection.
						</p>
					</Accordion>

					<Accordion title="What are the best free filtering options?">
						<p>
							Excellent free options exist that provide solid protection:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>OpenDNS FamilyShield:</strong> Pre-configured DNS filtering, blocks adult content</li>
							<li><strong>CleanBrowsing:</strong> Three free filter levels (Security, Adult, Family)</li>
							<li><strong>iOS Screen Time:</strong> Built-in content restrictions, app limits, communication controls</li>
							<li><strong>Android Family Link:</strong> Device management, app approval, activity tracking</li>
							<li><strong>Windows Family Safety:</strong> Web filtering, screen time, activity reports</li>
							<li><strong>Google SafeSearch:</strong> Filters search results (can be enforced via DNS)</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Combining OpenDNS FamilyShield with built-in device controls provides excellent protection at zero cost.
						</p>
					</Accordion>

					<Accordion title="How often should I update my filtering settings?">
						<p>
							Regular maintenance ensures continued effectiveness:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Weekly:</strong> Review activity reports from monitoring software</li>
							<li><strong>Monthly:</strong> Check for router firmware updates, review blocked site logs</li>
							<li><strong>Quarterly:</strong> Audit all device settings, ensure filters are still active</li>
							<li><strong>Yearly:</strong> Re-evaluate age-appropriate restrictions, update family media agreement</li>
							<li><strong>Immediately:</strong> After getting new devices, OS updates, or discovering bypass attempts</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Subscribe to our <a href="/newsletter">newsletter</a> for alerts about platform changes that might affect your filtering.

			<!-- Parent-Specific Questions -->
			<section class="faq-section">
				<h2 class="section-title">Questions for Parents</h2>
				<div class="accordion-list">
					<Accordion title="Should I give my child a smartphone?">
						<p>
							This depends on maturity level, not just age. Consider these factors:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Can they follow rules about device usage?</li>
							<li>Do they demonstrate good judgment with screen time?</li>
							<li>Are they responsible with current devices?</li>
							<li>Is there a genuine need (safety, staying in touch)?</li>
							<li>Are they prepared for social pressures and peer dynamics?</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							<strong>Alternatives to full smartphones:</strong>
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Basic phones for calls/texts only (Gabb Phone, Light Phone)</li>
							<li>Smartwatches with limited functionality (Gizmo Watch, Apple Watch with Family Setup)</li>
							<li>Heavily locked-down smartphones (Bark Phone, Pinwheel)</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							If you do provide a smartphone, implement strong filtering from day one. It's much harder to add restrictions later.
						</p>
					</Accordion>

					<Accordion title="How do I balance privacy with safety as kids get older?">
						<p>
							Gradually shift from protection to guidance as maturity increases:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Ages 6-10:</strong> Full monitoring justified, minimal privacy expectations</li>
							<li><strong>Ages 11-13:</strong> Continue monitoring but with more transparent communication</li>
							<li><strong>Ages 14-16:</strong> Shift to spot-checking and trust-but-verify approach</li>
							<li><strong>Ages 17+:</strong> Focus on accountability rather than monitoring</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Have explicit conversations: "At 16, we'll reduce monitoring to weekly check-ins. At 18, we'll transition to
							optional accountability if you want it."
						</p>
					</Accordion>

					<Accordion title="What if my child finds inappropriate content despite filtering?">
						<p>
							No filter is perfect. When this happens:
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li><strong>Stay calm:</strong> Your reaction sets the tone for future conversations</li>
							<li><strong>Talk about it:</strong> Ask what they saw, how they felt, whether they sought it out</li>
							<li><strong>Don't shame:</strong> Curiosity is normal; focus on healthy boundaries</li>
							<li><strong>Update filters:</strong> Report the site, add it to block lists</li>
							<li><strong>Reinforce values:</strong> Discuss why certain content isn't healthy or appropriate</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							View these moments as teaching opportunities rather than failures.
						</p>
					</Accordion>

					<Accordion title="How much screen time is appropriate?">
						<p>
							American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Under 18 months:</strong> No screen time except video chatting</li>
							<li><strong>Ages 2-5:</strong> 1 hour/day of high-quality programming</li>
							<li><strong>Ages 6-12:</strong> 1-2 hours/day of recreational screen time</li>
							<li><strong>Ages 13-18:</strong> 2 hours/day, with flexibility for homework/creative projects</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Quality matters more than quantity. Educational content, video calls with family, and creative projects are
							different from passive scrolling. See our <a href="/guides/screen-time-management">screen time management guide</a>
							for implementation strategies.
						</p>
					</Accordion>

					<Accordion title="Should I monitor my teen's private conversations?">
						<p>
							This is ethically complex. Consider this framework:
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Do monitor:</strong>
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Who they're communicating with (contact lists, friend requests)</li>
							<li>Patterns of usage (late-night messaging, excessive use)</li>
							<li>Red flags (conversations with strangers, requests for photos/personal info)</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							<strong>Don't monitor:</strong>
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Every message with known friends (micromanaging damages trust)</li>
							<li>Conversations without good reason (random spot-checks feel invasive)</li>
							<li>Secret monitoring (always be transparent about what you review)</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Use AI-powered tools like Bark that alert you to concerning language rather than showing you every message.
						</p>
					</Accordion>

					<Accordion title="How do I enforce rules when other parents don't?">
						<p>
							This is challenging but manageable:
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li><strong>Communicate your values:</strong> Explain to your child WHY you have rules</li>
							<li><strong>Connect with like-minded families:</strong> Build a community with similar standards</li>
							<li><strong>Talk to other parents:</strong> Share your approach (they may not have considered it)</li>
							<li><strong>Compromise appropriately:</strong> Distinguish non-negotiables from flexibility</li>
							<li><strong>Offer alternatives:</strong> Host kids at your house where rules apply</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							Frame it positively: "We're not against technology, we're for healthy technology use."
						</p>
					</Accordion>

					<Accordion title="What are warning signs my child has seen harmful content?">
						<p>
							Behavioral red flags to watch for:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Sudden secrecy about device use</li>
							<li>Quickly closing screens when you approach</li>
							<li>Increased device use late at night</li>
							<li>Changes in behavior, mood, or sleep patterns</li>
							<li>Withdrawal from family activities</li>
							<li>Age-inappropriate sexual knowledge or language</li>
							<li>Increased anxiety or depression</li>
							<li>New "friends" they can't or won't explain</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							If you notice these signs, have a gentle conversation. Professional help may be needed for significant exposure
							to harmful content.
						</p>
					</Accordion>

					<Accordion title="Should I filter content for myself as a parent?">
						<p>
							Many parents find personal filtering helpful:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Model healthy habits:</strong> Kids imitate what they see</li>
							<li><strong>Prevent accidental exposure:</strong> Protects you from unwanted content</li>
							<li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Voluntary monitoring strengthens personal integrity</li>
							<li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Rules work better when applied family-wide</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Adults can use accountability apps like Covenant Eyes or Accountable2You with a trusted friend or spouse.
							See our <a href="/individuals">personal accountability guide</a>.
						</p>
					</Accordion>

					<Accordion title="How do I handle gaming and online interactions?">
						<p>
							Gaming requires specific protections:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Console parental controls:</strong> Set age ratings, disable voice chat, restrict purchases</li>
							<li><strong>Communication limits:</strong> Disable chat with strangers or all chat initially</li>
							<li><strong>Privacy settings:</strong> Make profiles private, disable friend requests from strangers</li>
							<li><strong>Time limits:</strong> Set daily or weekly play time limits</li>
							<li><strong>Supervised play:</strong> Keep gaming devices in common areas</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							See our comprehensive <a href="/guides/gaming-safety">gaming safety guide</a> for platform-specific instructions.
						</p>
					</Accordion>

					<Accordion title="What's the best way to teach kids about online safety?">
						<p>
							Effective online safety education includes:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Start early:</strong> Begin conversations before giving devices</li>
							<li><strong>Ongoing dialogue:</strong> Regular check-ins, not one-time talks</li>
							<li><strong>Age-appropriate info:</strong> Tailor discussions to developmental level</li>
							<li><strong>Practical scenarios:</strong> "What would you do if..." questions</li>
							<li><strong>Emphasize reporting:</strong> Create safe space to report uncomfortable situations</li>
							<li><strong>Teach critical thinking:</strong> How to evaluate sources, spot manipulation</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Consider attending our <a href="/guides/community-education">community education workshops</a> or hosting one
							at your school/religious institution.

						<p>
							Communicate that filtering protects the entire community and occasional inconvenience serves the greater good.
						</p>
					</Accordion>

					<Accordion title="Should we offer unfiltered WiFi for visitors?">
						<p>
							This is a balance between hospitality and values:
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Option 1: Single filtered network</strong>
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Simpler management</li>
							<li>Consistent values</li>
							<li>May frustrate visitors with legitimate needs</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							<strong>Option 2: Filtered + guest network</strong>

					<Accordion title="What if community members resist filtering policies?">
						<p>
							Address resistance through education and dialogue:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Present data:</strong> Share statistics on internet dangers</li>
							<li><strong>Share testimonials:</strong> Stories from affected families (with permission)</li>
							<li><strong>Invite feedback:</strong> Collaborative policy development increases buy-in</li>
							<li><strong>Start gradually:</strong> Pilot program before full rollout</li>
							<li><strong>Offer alternatives:</strong> Those who object can opt not to use institutional internet</li>
							<li><strong>Leadership example:</strong> Leaders should model healthy digital habits</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Frame filtering as protection, not punishment; as support for families, not distrust of community members.
